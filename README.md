e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a competition organised by IIT,Bombay for undergraduate students in science and colleges. e-Yantra is a project sponsored by MHRD, Government of India, under the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT)

# Theme: Supply Bot
The theme of the project is Flood Disaster Management using a “Supply Bot”.

The idea is to build a robot to provide relief aid to the affected district or cities. The relief aid to be received by the affected areas is communicated wirelessly to the robot using a camera. Once the robot has identified the affected area, moving the relief aid as close as possible to the affected district or city is the primary task of the Supply Bot.
